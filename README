  --~~ Honeypot for Rails ~~--
  
  Honeypot is spam protection. Your from has a e-mail field. It is
  hidden with CSS. Only spam-bots are inhuman enough to fill out that
  field. If it has data in it, the request is terminated.
  
  Yay, easy spam protection!
  
  
  --~~ Installing ~~--
  
  1. ./script/plugin install git://github.com/augustl/rails_honeypot.git
  2. Add <%= f.honeypot %> to your `form_for`-forms.
  3. Add ".attack_of_the_titans { display:none }" to your CSS.
  
  
  You can configure the name of the hidden form field in an initializer:
  Honeypot.form_field = :email
